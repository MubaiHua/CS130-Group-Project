For other albums of similar name, see Bedtime story (disambiguation).) Bedtime Stories is the sixth studio album by American singer Madonna. It was released on October 25, 1994, by Maverick and Warner Bros. Records. Madonna collaborated with Dallas Austin, Babyface, Dave ""Jam"" Hall, and Nellee Hooper in order to move into a more mainstream sound. The singer wanted to soften her image following the critical and commercial backlash she faced after releasing sexually explicit projects in the previous two years, notably the Erotica album and the book Sex in 1992.
